## Homework 2: Due 2022.09.06 

This week we have a written part and an implementation part. 

### Written part 

Answer the questions found in `main.tex` and turn your answers in by uploading them

you want. Only your final submission counts.

Remember this is math class so be sure to justify your answers. You will be 
graded on correctness and 

Note: when you submit, your filename must be `solutions.pdf` and it must be a pdf. 

(Hint: an adapted solution to the implementation could help you answer some 
of the questions...)

### Implementation part 

Make `euclid_algo.go` work. There are more detailed instructions in the comments.
